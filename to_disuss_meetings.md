**17/05**:
- analyzed dataset
- distribution of classes and types
- transformers ? (sort of time series)

TODO
- filter face points (keep mouth and eyes as a priority)
- remove z values
- use sequential architectures (start with a simple model)
- look for ideas on Kaggle 
- try to plot frames (using scatter plots)

**researchs until next meetings**:
- CoAtNet: combination of CNN and Transformer

- 

**28/05**
DONE
- preprocessed data (remove NaN, normalization, filter landmarks)
- removed z coordinates
- research on architectures (among top participants and on the internet)

QUESTIONS
- data augmentation ? (rotations, zoom)
- is normalization useful ?
