**17/05**:
- analyzed dataset
- distribution of classes and types
- transformers ? (sort of time series)

TODO
- filter face points (keep mouth and eyes as a priority)
- remove z values
- use sequential architectures (start with a simple model)
- look for ideas on Kaggle 
- try to plot frames (using scatter plots)
